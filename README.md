# Work-Day-Scheduler
A simple calendar app to schedule workday events, featuring third party APIs

## Description 

My task was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am-5pm) by modifying starter code. 

I used the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. 

## Usage
