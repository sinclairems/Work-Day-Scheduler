# Work-Day-Scheduler
A simple calendar app to schedule workday events, featuring third party APIs

## Description 

My task was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am-5pm) by modifying starter code. 

I used the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. 

## Usage

Here is where to use the app! https://sinclairems.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

## Credits

I used class notes and MDN. 

Eventually I found an example by a fellow bootcamper and borrowed some JS code to make this app work. https://github.com/sylviaprabudy/work-day-scheduler
